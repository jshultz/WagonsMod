Hey all!

Hope there is someone around to see this, I just talked with Lil Avii the author of the Simply Horses mod.
I told her about the Wagons Mod and our efforts to recreate Wagons in Minecraft. 
After talking to her for awhile she agreed to dig up her old sources and help us out with this project!
Now I'm looking for anyone who contributed to this github who is willing to help get this project back off the ground.
If your interested shoot me an invite on $kype: EliteScythers 
Make sure you say your from the Wagons mod so I'll accept your request

Thanks all for your time!
